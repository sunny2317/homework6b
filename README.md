Site Explanation: </br>
This site allows users to book a COVID-19 testing appointment and then delete it. The user first enters the Home page and sees tasks that they still have left. They then click on the appointment tab and sees different things they can do — view upcoming appointments, make COVID-19 Testing appointments, and vaccine appointments. Since this site only has the COVID-19 Testing functionality, they click on it and are able to select a time and date that works for them. After checking it’s for sure the time that they want, they submit the appointment and it leads them to an appointment details page with their information. It also indicates that it was sent to their email in their profile. If the user wants to cancel their appointment, they visit the upcoming appointments page and click on the trash can icon so it is cleared. Then they can start all over again and make another appointment. </br>

Bonus: </br>
One interesting Javascript functionality I added was user confirmation. On the page where the user selects their appointment details in the dropdown, what the user selects shows up on the page so they can confirm it’s what they want before submitting. This also follows the heuristic of visibility of system status.
